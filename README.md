# TASK-1---API-calls-and-caching


TASK 1 - API calls and caching:
Make an image Gallery mobile app 
Should show recent images from Flickr using API 1 on the homepage.
Should have a left navbar. Use “home” as the option.
Use image caching so that if the app is opened offline, the last view should be retained for the homepage and the photos. In case API response changes, the view must refresh (only if the API response changes). [check Instagram for reference]
As a task submission, you will be required to send a 1-minute video of functionality to your hiring manager.
Github code is only required when asked for.
